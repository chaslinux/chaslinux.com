      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware-and-linux-distribution-differences&#34;&gt;Hardware and Linux Distribution Differences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post covers a bunch of areas of media decoding and encoding that I’ve discovered over a number of years using Debian-based distributions like Xubuntu, and Linux Mint. Primarily I’ll cover some of the differences between Xubuntu and Linux Mint, how various hardware (CPUs and graphics cards) encode video, and some of the “gotchas” when it comes to different methods as they apply to Handbrake (software) and MakeMKV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-lives-it-dies&#34;&gt;It lives, it dies!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new TrueNAS server is up, and all the hardware is working, but not without some hiccups on the way. After taking a lot longer to build than expect, I was so happy the other evening when I posted about the successful Power On Self Test (POST), and the new RAM (32GB) being properly detected. Exhausted at the end of the day I left the drives disconnected and the video card out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;most-of-the-hardware-is-assembled&#34;&gt;Most of the hardware is assembled&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks have been extremely busy, so I knew last night would probably be the only time I would get this week to work on the NAS. I’m glad I started building the NAS last night as it took much longer than anticipated. I finally finished the build at 10pm last night (and it’s still not quite complete).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;past&#34;&gt;Past&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isopropyl is a great way to clean up a lot of plastic, but I found that while it’s helpful for removing grime, caked on stickers (Goo Gone), and other crud, it doesn’t always leave a nice finish. A few years back a volunteer at the Computer Recycling Project mentioned interning at a small computer store where they used Mr. Clean Magic Erasers to clean-up the top of ThinkPads. True to what he said, Mr. Clean Magic Erasers do seem to be a pretty good job on the top of ThinkPads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-more-to-a-low-power-solution&#34;&gt;Moving more to a low-power solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months back I replaced the motherboard in the KODI media centre PC that sits in our living room. For many years our media centre has been rocking a Gigabyte motherboard with a second generation Core i7-2600 CPU. The Core i7-2600 came out in Q4 of 2010, making it almost 14 years old at the time I’m writing this. Still, it’s not a bad CPU. For several years it was the system I was compressing our movie collection on as the A8-5600K 4 core APU that was in my workstation (at the time) had about half the performance of the i7-2600. But about six months ago I replaced the CPU and motherboard with a still old, but more modern solution, a MSI motherboard and an Intel Core i3-7100.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an older post, reposted from the old web site. The project has since mostly switched to Linux Mint XFCE
versions 21.3 (Virginia) and 22.1 (Xia). We still have Xubuntu 24.04.2 on our PXE server, but only install it on request.
Our checklist has evolved and we&amp;rsquo;ve separated some steps into other checklists.
See my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/chaslinux&#34;&gt;github repositories&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workstation-class-hardware-at-a-deeply-discounted-price&#34;&gt;Workstation class hardware at a deeply discounted price&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and then the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theworkingcentre.org/cr/&#34;&gt;Computer Recycling Project&lt;/a&gt; at The Working Centre gets a really interesting piece of hardware donated. As a not-for-profit project, most of our equipment is aimed at people who are lower income. This generally translates into lower prices, even for some equipment others would list for a lot more. But that doesn’t mean the project just wipes the machines, installs Linux, and dumps the equipment on a sales shelf… often equipment requires a little, or a lot more work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Xubuntu 24.04 bugs so far - May 3 2024</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; While I tried using Linux Mint XFCE at home for awhile, I still found Xubuntu 24.04.2 works best for my use
cases. There are some filesystem differences, and while I was adverse to snaps because of control issues, I&amp;rsquo;m finding they
have some advantages over flatpak that I like. This is a repost from the old website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xubuntu-linux-version-2404-is-out&#34;&gt;Xubuntu Linux version 24.04 is out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 24.04 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://xubuntu.org&#34;&gt;Xubuntu&lt;/a&gt; Linux is now out! Xubuntu Linux has been a staple of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theworkingcentre.org/cr/&#34;&gt;Computer Recycling Project&lt;/a&gt; @ The Working Centre since 2010. With the project switching mostly to Linux, it’s now more important than ever that we’re up to date on trends, and new developments that affect the project. This new version of Xubuntu has a number of nice improvements, but in my testing on several different machines I’ve run into a number of issues as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;migrating-the-kodi-entertainment-system&#34;&gt;Migrating the KODI entertainment system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5th I mentioned that we’re Running out of space on our media center. In the comments of that post I followed up outlining a plan to buy another 8TB drive (for a total of 3 x 8TB drives) in order to do a RAID Z1 (for 16TB of space). But in order to do that I would need to reformat the drives, which means I also needed a plan to back up our media center data. I hinted at that solution in the comments too: 4 x 3TB drives in a RAID Z1 – which would give me 9TB of space (1 x 3TB is the spare), just enough to back up all the data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-problem-is-power-management-workaround&#34;&gt;The problem is power management (workaround)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve installed Xubuntu 22.04 on your laptop and things are going smoothly… Then you close the lid on your laptop and discover when you open it back up again that when you move the mouse it moves, but you cannot right or left click for some reason? The issue appears to be with power management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work around we found that appears to fix this is to edit the file:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adding a laser printer as a shared network printer in Xubuntu Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;switching-printers-at-home&#34;&gt;Switching printers at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than running out of toner, there was nothing wrong with the HP Laserjet P1102w printer we have at home. The printer printed cleanly, was compact, and was connected to our wireless network, so any machine on our network could print to it. In fact, I was planning on buying more toner this evening after we did our usual scouring of thrift shops. I thought there was a small chance I might find the right HP 85A toner at one of the stores we planned to go to. I did find some other toner at one of the thrift shops, and the $5.95 price tag wasn’t bad, but it was for a different model in the same line of printers. But this was actually after spotting an even better deal, an HP Laserjet 1320 duplex printer for a whopping $10.95.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Fix] OBS Studio records static desktop image, no movement</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;obs-is-awesome&#34;&gt;OBS is awesome!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Broadcasting Software, also known as OBS Studio, is an awesome piece of free and open source software that lets you capture audio and video from a wide variety of sources: screen capture, webcam, audio capture from the system, from an external source, from static images, slide shows, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been awhile since I’ve used OBS to capture the desktop of one of the systems at work, an ASUS M51AC desktop with an i7-4770 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. I installed OBS 30.0.1 and started to record a video of the desktop, using the webcam microphone for audio. After a bit of tweaking, adjusting Xubuntu’s microphone sensitivity, I managed to get audio recording correctly so audio levels did not “clip” (go into the red) in OBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Linux BASH shell script to create a PDF of monitor information - findmonitor.sh</title>
      <link>/posts/a_linux_shell_script_to_create_a_pdf_of_monitor_information_findmonitor/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-findmonitorsh&#34;&gt;About findmonitor.sh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Note: This script is NOT compatible with systems running Wayland. We use Xubuntu Linux at our project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Working Centre’s not-for-profit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theworkingcentre.org/cr/&#34;&gt;Computer Recycling Project&lt;/a&gt; sometimes receives donations of many monitors all at once. Our previous method for handling monitors was to set them up, run them through a bunch of tests, print a label on our label printer, and enter the monitor into our point of sale. This method hasn’t worked very well for us when we’ve received a lot of monitors all at once. Large amounts of monitors were sitting untested for awhile because we didn’t have the resources to do the old process for each monitor. We needed a faster way to figure out some of the details of monitors, and make them easier to sell without needing to create labels and enter everything into the point of sale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Handbrake performance on more than 6 cores</title>

&lt;p&gt;Handbrake is a video transcoder. It’s normally used to convert and compress video from a format into a more compressed format. Handbrake comes in a command line version, handbrake-cli, and a graphical version, handbrake. I’ve seen it mentioned several times that Handbrake is best at 6 cores or less, after that the encoding returns are diminishing. I thought this was the case with some of my experimentation, but it seems the answer is more complicated – it depends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-the-script&#34;&gt;About the script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote the hardware.sh BASH script to make it a bit simpler for volunteers at The Working Centre’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theworkingcentre.org/cr/&#34;&gt;Computer Recycling Project&lt;/a&gt; to figure out what hardware was in a computer. For more than a dozen years we’ve been asking volunteers to gather information from the BIOS, or using phoronix-test-suite under our PXE booted Debian Live environment. Volunteers would write the information on quarter page-sized sheets we would attach to each computer. While this was a useful function to help volunteers get to know hardware in a computer, there were a few problems with this method:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
