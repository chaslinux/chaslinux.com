      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;previous-gamemaker-experience&#34;&gt;Previous GameMaker experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought version 1.4 of the Gamemaker game engine on a Humble Bundle many years ago. At the time Gamemaker ONLY ran under Microsoft Windows. It was possible to export games to Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-specifically), but you couldn’t run the game engine itself under Linux. Version 2.x came along, and I paid to upgrade to 2.x as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time between when I bought 1.4 and 2.x I started working on my Asteroids-like clone, Fasteroids: (&lt;a href=&#34;https://chaslinux.itch.io/fasteroids)&#34;&gt;https://chaslinux.itch.io/fasteroids)&lt;/a&gt;. Many professional developers suggest starting and finishing a project as quickly as you can, then moving on to something else. Of course I didn’t listen and kept adding “features” to Fasteroids, which lead to the game being pretty messed up, and me losing interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
