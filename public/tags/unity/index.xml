      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this experience, and some back and forth with GameMaker, the GameMaker team switched the licensing back to a one time fee (except for console exports),
and they released a beta version of the engine for Ubuntu-based systems. The team continues to update this beta along with the normal code. Since I previously
had experience with GameMaker I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to stick with it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really thrilled with it as bugs I&amp;rsquo;ve run into have been fixed a short while after
I&amp;rsquo;ve reported them, and the community have been great helping me solve issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
